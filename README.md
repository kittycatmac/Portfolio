# Portfolio
This website uses Forest Themed: Coda for overall design and build for the portfolio. This site is mobile responsive and uses webkits and javascript to create a more interactive design. 

# To Get Started
Navagate the site several ways: click on "menu" in right corner, scroll down and click "scroll to top" to return to intro and also hover over links that highlight and then click to get the pop-up windows or links to other sites.  

Built with: Coda~ HTML, CSS, Javascript

# Deployment
If deployed there would need to be a back-end message system to send to my personal email and a pop-up window to send an email to my email address from outlook.
